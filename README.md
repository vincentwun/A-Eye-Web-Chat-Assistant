- Download [Chrome Dev](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/) or [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/)
- Verify version ≥ 128.0.6545.0 at `chrome://settings/help`

### Extension Setup

1. Download Extension
   ```
   https://github.com/vincentwun/A-Eye-Web-Chat-Assistant/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   ```

2. Chrome Configuration
   - Launch Chrome browser
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (top-right corner)
   - Select "Load unpacked"
   - Navigate to extracted extension directory
   - Select `A-Eye-Web-Chat-Assistant-main/A-Eye-Web-Chat-Assistant` directory

### Required Configuration

#### Chrome Flags Setup

| Category | Flag | Setting |
|----------|------|---------|
| WebGPU | `chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu-developer-features` | Enabled |
| Gemini Nano | `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model` | Enabled BypassPerfRequirement |
| Prompt API | `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` | Enabled |

**Important:**  
After modifying the flags above, **please restart Chrome** to apply the changes. Failure to do so may result in the settings not being properly activated.

#### Built-in AI Model (Gemini Nano) Setup

**Step 1: Model Initialization**  
1. To trigger the Gemini Nano download, open the [Prompt API Playground](https://chrome.dev/web-ai-demos/prompt-api-playground/)  
```
https://chrome.dev/web-ai-demos/prompt-api-playground/
```
2. Launch the **DevTools Console** (`F12`).
3. Execute:  
   ```javascript
   (await ai.languageModel.capabilities()).available;
   ```
4. If prompted to manually type "allow pasting", do so before proceeding.
5. If the return value is `"after-download"`:  
   - Go to **chrome://components** and ensure the **Optimization Guide On Device Model** version is **≥ 2024.5.21.1031**.  
   - If outdated, click **"Check for update"**. *(Download time may vary.)*
6. If the return value is `"no"`:  
   - In **DevTools Console**, run:  
     ```javascript
     await ai.languageModel.create();
     ```  
   - This may fail, which is expected.  
   - Relaunch Chrome.
   - Open **DevTools Console** again and execute:  
     ```javascript
     (await ai.languageModel.capabilities()).available;
     ```
   - The return value should now be `"after-download"`.
   - Go to **chrome://components** and verify that the **Optimization Guide On Device Model** version is **≥ 2024.5.21.1031**.
